# Arduino-Midi-Controller [JBG Installation]

This project consists of a set of ultrasonic range finders and an Arduino acting as a midi controller and a DMX lighting controller. The hardware, connected to a laptop, is located inside a geodesic structure surrounded by 4 speakers. Each range finder, when triggered, will change a different setting in Ableton (tone, pitch, etc.) and affect the color of the LED lights.
